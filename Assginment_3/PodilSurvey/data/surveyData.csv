(1) the community, which formed during last 5-6 years. Podil has one of the most active civil communities, dealing with local (district) and general (city) urban issues

(3) though traffic jams often block the district, in general Podil is one of the best-situated districts in the city. If in the mood, there's a lot of places you can go get foot
(4) it's one of the best districts to walk in the city. It's very nice and pleasant to walk around Podil 
(5) accessibility to the river
(6) Podil has 3 subway stations, which makes it very easy to get around

Dislike
(1) streets of Podil are very bad - that goes both for roads and pavements
(2) buildings at Podil are mostly old and therefore close to / are in critical condition, which makes living here quite a struggle (either you rent or own the apartment)

I am not against nightlife, but these bars do not control or pay attention to how much the guests drink, which results in drunk men standing outside in the streets, catcalling women, fighting or screaming which makes it impossible to sleep, especially during the summer. Also, Kontraktova square was closed for the traffic, which was initially a good idea to create a green recreation zone, but nothing has been done since then, it is just a giant asphalted square, where a lot of people sell food and alcohol illegally now. No one controls or regulates the events there, which results in enormously loud music of poor quality during the weekends. What has been done to Sagaidachnogo is awful. In the summer beer was sold there, people just threw plastic glasses on the ground and urinated in the park. In winter pine trees were chopped and just tied to the pillar lamps as is, the Christmas lights were not for outside usage, so basically anyone can die after an electric shock there now.

(1) the community, which formed during last 5-6 years. Podil has one of the most active civil communities, dealing with local (district) and general (city) urban issues
(2) the urban infrastructure: shops, coffee shops, bars, restaurants, clubs etc - hip, trendy and democratic at the same time
(3) though traffic jams often block the district, in general Podil is one of the best-situated districts in the city. If in the mood, there's a lot of places you can go get foot
(4) it's one of the best districts to walk in the city. It's very nice and pleasant to walk around Podil 
(5) accessibility to the river
(6) Podil has 3 subway stations, which makes it very easy to get around

Dislike
(1) streets of Podil are very bad - that goes both for roads and pavements
(2) buildings at Podil are mostly old and therefore close to / are in critical condition, which makes living here quite a struggle (either you rent or own the apartment)
(3) traffic jams: every working day mornings and evenings the district is literally paralized","Yes","Working In Podil is not very much unlike living in Podil, so all of the above applies here.

I'd like to have an office here again, so it'd be closer to where I leave, and the commute would not take so much time during the working days","Strongly agree","Parkovy (Pedestrian) Bridge, which is for me marks one of the Podil's borders.

All the Dnipro river bank in Podil area is very beautiful, it's one of the few places in town where river bank is actually a public space, when you can walk, run, enjoy the view etc

Postal Square and River Station: here old Kyiv architecture remains more or less untouched and unspoiled, the square offers pleasant differentiations of city landscape: hills, river, fountain, old River Station building, etc

Sahaydachnogo Str.: you may call it 'Podil's broadway', especially that now it's half pedestrian. Old street with pretty late 18th and 19th buildings, lots of restaurants, cafes and shops

Also Volodymyrivska hill, funicular, Sofia area (this is all one cozy place for a walk). Khreshchatyk is beautiful, because there is a spacious sidewalk, but, unfortunately, the trees have been destroyed. Also, the street Mezhygirskaya, in general, the area between Taras Shevchenko and Kontraktovoy - there is a cozy place to walk, and there are not so many noisy entertainment facilities like near Kontraktova. Another cool baby railroad. Also - Arch of Peoples&#39; Friendship is very beautiful.","","",NA,"","Unfortunately, I&#39;m not very familiar with the history of Kiev. But the center of Kiev, built in the style of the Stalinist Empire, although it is a relic of the Soviet era, but says a lot about it. This is the face of the city as it is. The grapevine is good as a project of Soviet planning, an area with a very good infrastructure.","","",NA,"","No","","I like the fact that Podol has many creative, interesting people. Going there, I can always see someone else. And there are places for such meetings. Also, unlike Khreshchatyk, for example, Podol is very convenient for walking through specific planning. It seems that everything is compact and close. High concentration of interesting objects at a small (relative) distance between them. At the same time, the last couple of years is continuing the &quot;reconstruction&quot; of the Podil: blocked Kontraktova, made there a bazaar, rebuilt Sagaidachny and Post. The initiatives are cool, but in fact we see the commercialization of the Podil, distorting it. For example, there were several weekends there were car and motorcycle promotions - the noise level was simply unbelievable. This kind of handling of space eliminates the huge number of visitors to the Podol, makes a place uncomfortable for anyone. I&#39;m currently avoiding these parts - Kontraktovoy and Sagaidachny - more than before they were blocked for cars.","Yes","The experience of work was positive - it is in the center, conveniently, there are places where you can have a cheap lunch or go to the store. On Podil there is another plus that there are no super-expensive places where you feel uncomfortable. That is, there are second-hand alternatives, and just some strange store. That&#39;s why there you do not feel like in any kind of business center.","Yes of course. It is very comfortable, comfortable, close.","Agree","For me, places are rather comfortable and meaningful - where I want to spend time and spend.
